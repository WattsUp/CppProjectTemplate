## Building ##
### Git Clone ###
Clone the repository and its submodules
```bash
> mkdir workspace
> cd workspace
> git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/WattsUp/CppProjectTemplate myProject
```

### Manually Building ###
Configure the project with default compiler and compile
```bash
> cmake . -B build
> cmake --build build
```

### Building in VSCode ###
1. Open the project folder in VSCode with the recommended extensions
2. Open the CMake Tools tab
3. Select `Configure All Projects`, select appropriate compiler
4. Click `Build All Projects`

## Folder Structure ##
* `bin`       Binary folder, output directory for executables, add runtime resources here (icons, etc.)
* `common`    Common code shared amongst projects: logging, utilities, etc.
* `include`   Public include folder for libraries
* `libraries` Third party libraries usually included as a `git submodule`
* `tools`     Helper code such as check coding conventions script

### Projects ###
* `project-installer` installer executable which sets up directories, variables, etc.
* `project-fractal`   Application to draw a fractal to the console

## Adapting ##
1. Clone the repository, see [Git Clone](#git-clone). (Or download manually)
2. Run the python script `tools/SetupProject.py` from the top level folder. It will guide you through the process. The script checks for all software dependencies (prompts for their installation), modifies top-level project name, modifies targets, resets the git repository to an initial commit, and tags the commit v0.0.0. The only dependency is the ability to run python scripts.

### Modify Project Name ###
Change `project("project-template")` to `project("[top-level-project-name]")` in `./CMakeLists.txt`

### Modify Sub Projects and Targets ###
1. Modify/create folders for each sub project, see [Folder Structure](#folder-structure)
2. Modify/create target names in all `CMakeLists.txt`:
```CMake
set (TARGETS
  "[target-name-1]" # [Optional comment]
  "[Target name 2]" # [Optional comment]
)
```
and
```CMake
target_sources("[Target name 1]" PRIVATE ${SRCS})
```
**Note:** Target names cannot have spaces in CMake. To have spaces in the output files uncomment the following in `./CMakeLists.txt` and duplicate as needed:
```CMake
set_target_properties([TargetNoSpaces] PROPERTIES OUTPUT_NAME "Target With Spaces")
```
3. Add the appropriate subdirectories to `./CMakeLists.txt`
```CMake
# Add each subdirectory
add_subdirectory("common")
add_subdirectory("project-installer")
add_subdirectory("project-fractal")
```
